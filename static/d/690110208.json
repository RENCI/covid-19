These features make the device highly reproducible and mobile. Designed by Kirk Wilhelmsen, MD, PhD, a professor in the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Medicine’s Department of Genetics and chief domain scientist for genomics at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), the APOGEE meets technical standards required in a ventilator while still adhering to design principles that allow for mass-production from readily available, off-the-shelf parts by those with minimal technical skill. Simple mechanical design reduces the possibility of failure, and interchangeable parts (any that come in contact with gas are medical grade) are easily serviced by a respiratory therapist. The design also includes an LCD touch screen with a web interface for monitoring machines from a workstation. APOGEE will support synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV), tidal volume of 100-1500cc, inspiratory pressure limit of 5-50cm H20, PEEP 0-30cm H20, and room air to 100% O2.</p>\n<p>The driving force moving air is gravity acting on water. Pressures are regulated by controlling the hydrostatic heads. A pump or a source of tap water maintains the hydrostatic head in a reservoir. Trivial mechanical actions allow the adjustment of tidal volume, inspiratory pressure limit, PEEP, and percent O2. Pressure monitors allow adjustment of the sensitivity of the inspiratory effort trigger. Pinch valves control the movement of gas and water.</p>\n<p>A Linux CPU and touch screen control the respiratory rate and sensitivity to trigger an assisted ventilation with inspiratory effort. The screen displays the history and pressure of respiratory cycles in real-time. Tabs of the screen on the machine allow testing of specific mechanical functions. The CPU monitors the properties of the respiratory cycle, generates an alarm, and supports web services for remote monitoring.</p>\n<h2>Design Specs</h2>\n<p>Coming soon.</p>\n<h2>Image Gallery</h2>\n<p>Coming soon.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/answering-biomedical-questions","title":"Answering Biomedical Questions","blurb":"RENCI scientists are supporting rapid exploration of data by building a COVID-19 version of their question-answering system called Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways, or ROBOKOP.\n"},"html":"<p>RENCI scientists are supporting rapid exploration of data by building a COVID-19 version of their question-answering system called Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways (<a href=\"https://robokop.renci.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ROBOKOP</a>).</p>\n<p>ROBOKOP is a biomedical question-answering system based on a knowledge graph, meaning that it expresses data as a collection of nodes—such as genes and diseases—and edges that represent the relationships between the nodes. ROBOKOP uses multiple open biomedical databases to explore relationships between various biomedical data types. For example, it can be used to examine relationships between a disease and a drug and then explore which genes might be involved in that association.</p>\n<p>RENCI scientists have created a special COVID instance of ROBOKOP by integrating the original knowledge graph with the CORD-19 literature co-occurrence graphs they developed, viral protein functions, and hand-curated symptom information. This combination will give scientists access to a vast amount of information about human genes, chemicals, and respiratory diseases and allow them to ask important questions about how that information relates to COVID-19.

They also performed this analysis using entities found by the SciBite team. This co-occurrence information forms a graph of entities that can be used directly or integrated into other databases such as ROBOKOP to perform even more complex data mining.</p>\n<p>The Scigraph and SciBite co-occurrence graphs are available at <a href=\"https://automat.renci.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">automat.renci.org</a>.</p>"}}]}}}
