The study is helping to advance research by offering free testing for COVID-19 antibodies and virus to members of UNC’s extended research community to monitor disease outbreak and reduce virus transmission.</p>\n<p>As students and workers return across the nation, it’s vital that we understand more about transmission on campus. This knowledge will inform best practices for testing methods and safety measures, and will help assess the usefulness of asymptomatic testing and contact tracing. The effort combines RENCI’s expertise in data science with UNC experts from the Depts. of Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases, Biology, and Microbiology and Immunology.</p>\n<p>Providing insights that make our communities safer is a key part of RENCI’s mission, and we’re even providing work space for the study as a sample collection and training site while our employees work from home.</p>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1187818409","262270362","2699212916","3077141978","63159454","692169453"]}
