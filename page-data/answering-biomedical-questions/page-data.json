ROBOKOP uses multiple open biomedical databases to explore relationships between various biomedical data types. For example, it can be used to examine relationships between a disease and a drug and then explore which genes might be involved in that association.</p>\n<p>RENCI scientists have created a special COVID instance of ROBOKOP by integrating the original knowledge graph with the CORD-19 literature co-occurrence graphs they developed, viral protein functions, and hand-curated symptom information. This combination will give scientists access to a vast amount of information about human genes, chemicals, and respiratory diseases and allow them to ask important questions about how that information relates to COVID-19. The new COVID-19 version of ROBOKOP is available at <a href=\"http://covidkop.renci.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://covidkop.renci.org/</a>.</p>"}},"pageContext":{}}}
