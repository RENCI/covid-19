RENCI researchers used the Semantic Scholar Open Research Dataset (<a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19\">CORD 19</a>)—a set of research papers covering COVID-19 and earlier coronaviruses—to create literature co-occurrence databases for COVID-19. Literature co-occurrence databases help automate knowledge gathering by revealing meaningful insights based on patterns and strengths of links between keywords in research papers. For example, researchers can use COVID-KOP to identify drugs that might be repurposed as a COVID-19 treatment or to uncover biochemical pathways that might be targeted with newly developed drugs.</p>\n<p>Data presented through COVID-KOP includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drugs in clinical trials against COVID-19 (from DrugBank)</li>\n<li>Literature Co-occurrences from CORD-19</li>\n<li>Viral Proteome annotations from GOA</li>\n<li>COVID-19 phenotypes</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1187818409","262270362","2699212916","3077141978","63159454","692169453"]}
