Chemotext has been used to conduct comparative bibliometric analysis of the research response to both previous epidemics and COVID-19 and create a list of compounds (including approved drugs) that were ever studied for effects on coronaviruses. 
ROBOKOP and Chemotext have been used to identify drug combinations that may be effective against COVID-19. Twenty combinations have been prioritized and submitted to the NCATS COVID-19 phenotypic assay group for testing.
