Developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Rapidly Emerging Antiviral Drug Development Initiatives AViDD Center (READDI-AC) platform integrates cutting-edge discovery-based academic science with product development-oriented industrial drug development transforming the historically reactive landscape of emerging virus drug development to one that is proactive. READDI-AC components are completed in part by the creation of a FAIR-compatible data analysis platform built on HeLx, alongside Dug as a semantic search and data discovery tool.
