blurb: >
    COVID-KOP (COVID linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways) is a biomedical reasoning system combining the existing knowledge in the ROBOKOP knowledge graph and COVID-19 data.

Dug is a semantic query and visualization environment for exploring connections between ontological biomedical data from sources like ROBOKOP, clinical cohorts via COVID-19 ICEES+, and research data such as [TOPMed](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/). Dug ingests study and variable metadata from sources like dbGaP into a knowledge graph, integrates that knowledge graph into Translator infrastructure, and combines these sources via the [TranQL](https://tranql.renci.org/) federated query interface.
