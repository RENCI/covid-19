# ICEES+ COVID-19 Open Infrastructure to Democratize and Accelerate Cross-institutional Clinical Data Sharing, Research, and Surveillance

With funding from NCATS, RENCI was granted a CTSA Program administrative supplement through NC TraCS to address COVID-19 public health needs. This award funds the development of an 'ICEES+ COVID-19 OpenAPI' designed to openly expose binned, de-identified data on patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 at UNC Health and matched controls. Electronic health record data are captured on elements of direct relevance to coronavirus infection and recovery, including treatments, interventions, comorbidities, and disposition. The data are integrated with public environmental exposures data to support research on environmental determinants of morbidity, recovery, and long-term outcomes. The ICEES+ COVID-19 OpenAPI will be freely available for both public health surveillance and research.
