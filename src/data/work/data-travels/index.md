## Introduction

RENCI scientists received a grant from the NC Policy Collaboratory to help fund their “Case Study of Data Travels,” a project summarizing all of the ways COVID-19 data is being collected and used throughout North Carolina.

As we face the COVID-19 pandemic, vast amounts of data are being created across the state by individuals, communities, hospitals, laboratories and other organizations. Data science can answer big questions, but only if we know the right questions to ask in the first place. Analyzing not just the data but the systems of collecting data is essential for contending with the current pandemic and building predictive models for the future.

The average North Carolinian is unclear how to grapple with the extensive amount of COVID-19 information they read and hear. RENCI is working alongside leading public health experts and medical professionals at UNC and statewide to document the data flow and create a report to inform research and decision-making. The power and potential of big data can catalyze the pandemic response and accelerate solutions to the challenges of tomorrow.
