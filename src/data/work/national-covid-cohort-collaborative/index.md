The [National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C)](https://covid.cd2h.org/N3C) is a collaboration between the NCATS CTSA programs, the National Center for Data to Health (CD2H), distributed clinical data networks (PCORnet, OHDSI, ACT, TriNetX), and other partners. The N3C aims to build a national COVID-19 data repository to advance the analysis of COVID-19 data and encourage data sharing on an unprecedented scale, ultimately leading to new discoveries for COVID-19 treatment and prevention. The Informatics and Data Science (IDSci) team at NC TraCS, UNCâ€™s CTSA program, serves as the Chief Architect for developing the repository. Given our partnership with NC TraCS, RENCI has committed to providing resources and personnel to help with this effort.
