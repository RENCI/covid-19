[COVID-KOP](https://covidkop.renci.org/) (COVID linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways) is a biomedical reasoning system combining the existing knowledge in the ROBOKOP knowledge graph and COVID-19 data. RENCI researchers used the Semantic Scholar Open Research Dataset ([CORD 19](https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19))—a set of research papers covering COVID-19 and earlier coronaviruses—to create literature co-occurrence databases for COVID-19. Literature co-occurrence databases help automate knowledge gathering by revealing meaningful insights based on patterns and strengths of links between keywords in research papers. For example, researchers can use COVID-KOP to identify drugs that might be repurposed as a COVID-19 treatment or to uncover biochemical pathways that might be targeted with newly developed drugs.

Data presented through COVID-KOP includes:
- Drugs in clinical trials against COVID-19 (from DrugBank)
- Literature Co-occurrences from CORD-19
- Viral Proteome annotations from GOA
- COVID-19 phenotypes
